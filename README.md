# EMF_Kits
This is a collection of kits made with/for the EMF (Erik's Mission Framework) made by Eric. 
All credit does do him. He made the .sqf file template and the EMF (obviously). 

Only thing that is done by me is putting in the classnames in the right place and sourcing the kits vom different sources.

You are free to use this in any mission. Just don't be retarded and charge money for it or some other retarded stuff. 

Needed Mods are all part of the modcollection useed by Cluster Community:

Current Kits:
- German Paratroopers ca. 2010
   G36 rifles with stock scopes no Zeiss optics.
   M92 Helmets and no heavy body armor. 

- German KSK from 1997 with all Black Uniforms (Helmet is unrealistc 
  since no realistic helmet present in modpack) with MP5's and G36K's. Aswell as one role with a shotgun. Which is also not the right one but whatever. This kit was sourced from pictures inside the K-ISOM special magazine about the KSK.
