## How to install
You will need EMF for this to work.                                                                           
Git clone the repository or download the zip (extract) to any folder.                                                         
Move the loadout you want into `yourmissionfolder\rsc\loadouts`.                                      
Then go into `initPlayerLocal.sqf` and change the filename `USA_EARLY90_RANGER_DESERT` inside 
```sqf
[["USA_EARLY90_RANGER_DESERT"]] call EMF_fnc_kosherArsenalLoad;
```
to whatever the name is of the loadout you want.
