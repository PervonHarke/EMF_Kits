# EMF_Kits
This is a collection of kits made with/for the EMF (Erik's Mission Framework) made by Eric. 
All credit does do him. He made the .sqf file template and the EMF (obviously). 

Only thing that is done by me is putting in the classnames in the right place and sourcing the kits vom different sources.

You are free to use this in any mission. Just don't be retarded and charge money for it or some other retarded stuff.
